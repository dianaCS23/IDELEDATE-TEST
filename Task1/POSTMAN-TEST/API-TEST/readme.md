API Overview
This API is built using Node.js and Express, and it simulates a product management system with basic CRUD operations. The API allows users to:

Retrieve the Latest Product: Fetches the most recent product from a mock database.
Update Product with Validation: Updates an existing productâ€™s price, ensuring the price is not negative.
Add a New Product with Required Fields: Adds a new product to the database, requiring a title and price, and returning an error if either is missing.
Delete a Product by ID: Deletes a product based on its ID, and returns a 404 if the product is not found
